## [Unreleased]
Nothing, yet.

## [3.5.2] - 2025-02-16
### Fixed
- Fix bug where invalid `mapscripts` syntax wasn't raising an error.

## [3.5.1] - 2024-11-24
### Fixed
- Fix bug where `\N` didn't respect `numLines` when using `format()`.

## [3.5.0] - 2024-11-10
### Added
- Movement can now be inlined within commands using a special `moves()` operator, similar to text. For example:
  ```
  applymovement(OBJ_EVENT_ID_PLAYER, moves(
      walk_left * 4
      face_down
  ))
  ```
- Print a warning message when `numLines` is missing from a font's config. Defaults to `numLines=2` in that case, rather than `0`.
- Added `msgbox` to the default `command_config.json`, since `msgbox(.., MSGBOX_YESNO)` would be a very common use case.

### Changed
- Multi-line string literals will now remove newline characters, and separate each line by a space character instead.
    - This should rarely, if ever, be used. But the previous behavior resulted in invalid compiled scripts.

## [3.4.0] - 2024-08-15
- Add support for AutoVar commands.
    - AutoVar commands can be used in place of the `var` operator to streamline comparisons.
    - AutoVar commands are defined in a new config file `command_config.json`.
- Fix missing semicon character in FireRed/LeafGreen font config

## [3.3.0] - 2024-01-15
- Add ability to configure number of lines used by `format()`. For example, this is useful if the text is intended to render in, a 3-line textbox (instead of the usual 2).
    - Additionally, `format()` now accepts named parameters, and `numLines` has been included in `font_config.json`.

## [3.2.0] - 2023-12-02
### Added
- Add `-lm` option for [C Preprocessor line markers](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.0.2/cpp_9.html) to improve error messages.
    - `-lm` is enabled by default. You can specify `-lm=false` to disable line markers in the compiled output.

## [3.1.0] - 2023-11-11
### Added
- Add support for configuration of the textbox's cursor width to improve `format()`'s ability to fit text on a line.
    - This is achieved with a new `cursorOverlapWidth` field in `font_config.json`
    - Note, this change also changed the `maxLineLength` of the `1_latin_frlg` font, so existing uses of `format()` could be affected--especially when used in combination with explicit line breaks inside the `format()` text content.
- Add automatic line break (`\N`) support to `format()`

## [3.0.3] - 2023-09-04
### Fixed
- Fix bug where specifying a non-default font id with `format()` would apply the wrong maximum line width configuration.

## [3.0.2] - 2023-05-20
### Fixed
- Fix bug where a `switch` statement with all empty `case` bodies would produce invalid output.

## [3.0.1] - 2023-01-08
### Fixed
- Fix bug where `end` and `return` commands could cause labels to not render.

## [3.0.0] - 2022-11-19
### Changed
- Font configuration file is now called `font_config.json`, and each font in that file contains a `maxLineLength` used by `format()`. The command-line option `-fw` has been renamed to `-fc` to reflect the new name of the font configuration file.

## [2.14.0] - 2022-06-27
### Added
- Add the ability to define sub-labels inside `script` statements. This is useful in some cases where it's more ergonomic to directly jump to a desired location inside a script, similar to C's goto labels.

## [2.13.0] - 2022-06-16
### Added
- Add `mart` statement, which is a convenient way to define a list of items used with the decomp's `pokemart` script command. Prior to this addition, the mart data had to be encoded using Poryscript's `raw` statement.

## [2.12.0] - 2021-12-27
### Added
- Add `value()` operator, which can be used on the right-hand side of a `var()` comparison. It will force a `compare_var_to_value` command to be output. This makes it possible to compare values that occupy the same range as vars (`0x4000 <= x <= 0x40FF` and `0x8000 <= x <= 0x8015`).
- Add ability to author inifinite loops using the `while` statement without any boolean expression.

## [2.11.0] - 2021-10-23
### Added
- Add -l command-line option to define default line length for formatted text.
- Add -f command-line option to define default font id from `font_widths.json` for formatted text.

## [2.10.0] - 2021-04-03
### Added
- Add ability to specify custom directives for text. (e.g. `ascii"My ASCII text"` will result in `.ascii "My ASCII text\0"`)

## [2.9.0] - 2020-09-07
### Added
- Add optional maximum line length parameter to `format()` operator.

## [2.8.1] - 2020-05-06
### Fixed
- Fix bug where `switch` statement `default` case didn't work properly when combined with other cases.

## [2.8.0] - 2020-03-25
### Added
- Add ability to use the NOT (`!`) operator in front of nested boolean expressions. Example: `if (flag(A) && !(flag(B) || flag(C)))`

## [2.7.2] - 2019-11-16
### Fixed
- Fix bug where implicit text labels weren't properly inserted into command arguments.

## [2.7.1] - 2019-11-13
### Fixed
- Fix bug where control codes with spaces in them (e.g. `{COLOR BLUE}`) were not handled properly in `format()`.

## [2.7.0] - 2019-11-05
### Added
- Add support for compile-time switches using the `poryswitch` statement. This helps with language differences or game-version differences, for example.
- Add support for user-defined constants with `const` keyword. This helps with things like defining event object ids to refer to throughout the script.

## [2.6.0] - 2019-10-26
### Added
- Add support for scope modifiers `global` and `local` for `script`, `text`, `movement`, and `mapscripts` statements. This will force labels for be generated with `::` (global) or `:` (local) in the compiled output script.

## [2.5.0] - 2019-10-16
### Added
- Comments can now be used with `//`, in addition to the existing '#' style. This is to support users who want to process Poryscript with the C preprocessor.
- Add `movement` statement, which is used to define movement data. Use `*` as a shortcut for repeating a movement command many times. `step_end` terminator is automatically added to the end of the data.
- Add `mapscripts` statement, which is used to define map scripts. Scripts can be inlined, or simply specified with a label.

### Fixed
- Fix harmless bug where `format()` could result in empty `.string ""` lines in the compiled out.
- Fix bug where `end` command was incorrectly being replaced with a `return`.
- Fix bug where negative numbers were not parsed correctly.

## [2.4.0] - 2019-10-13
### Added
- Add support for text auto-formatting with the `format()` operator. Font widths are loaded from a config JSON file. Specify config file with `-fw <config filepath>`. If `-fw` is omitted, Poryscript will try to load `font_widths.json` by default.

### Changed
- Text is now automatically terminated with a `$` character, so the user doesn't have to manually type it for all pieces of text. Of course, this does not apply to text within `raw` statements.

## [2.3.0] - 2019-10-12
## Added
- Add `defeated()` operator, which is used to check if a trainer has been defeated. Without this new `defeated()` operator, it was impossible to write scripts that checked trainer flags without using `raw`.
- Add `text` statements.

## [2.2.0] - 2019-10-07
### Changed
- Identical implicit texts are now combined into a single text output.

### Fixed
- Fix some potential infinite loops when parsing certain invalid scripts.

## [2.1.1] - 2019-09-14
### Fixed
- Fix bug where hexadecimal numbers were not tokenized correctly, resulting in a space after the `0x` prefix.

## [2.1.0] - 2019-09-11
### Added
- Add implicit truthiness checks for `var()` and `flag()` operators.
- Add NOT (`!`) prefix operator for `var()` and `flag()` operators.

### Changed
- Errors are now prefixed with `PORYSCRIPT`, and they are written to `stderr`, instead of `stdout`.
- The program will no longer panic when handled errors occur.

### Fixed
- Fix parser errors that were not showing the line number of the error.

## [2.0.0] - 2019-09-02
### Added
- Add single-line comments with the `#` character.
- Add `go.mod` file so the project can be built outside of the Go workspace.
- Add `while` loops.
- Add `do...while` loops.
- Add `break` and `continue` statements.
- Add compound boolean expressions.
- Add output optimization which significantly simplifies and shrinks the resulting compiled scripts. Turn off optimization by specifying `-optimize=false`.
- Add `switch` statements.

### Changed
- `raw` no longer takes a label name.
- Removed `raw_global`, since there is no longer a concept of being global or local for `raw`.

### Fixed
- Inline texts are now generated with labels that are prefixed to their parent script's name. Otherwise, they would easily clash with external scripts because they were all simply named `Text_<num>`.
